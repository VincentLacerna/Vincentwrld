    <P><b> Paul Walker Paul William Walker IV (September 12, 1973 â€“ November 30, 2013) was an American actor. He is best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in the Fast & Furious franchise.
        Walker died from injuries sustained from a single-vehicle collision on November 30, 2013. His father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his death, Walker had not completed filming Furious 7 (2015); it was released after rewrites and stand-ins, including his brothers Cody and Caleb, filled in for Walker, while the song "See You Again" by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth was commissioned as a tribute.</b>
